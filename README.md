TypeScript, often labelled as being a superset of JavaScript, is a language that has gained momentum recently. Think about it as JavaScript but supercharged.

Based on the above, commonly heard explanation, one may think that TypeScript is an easy language to learn, however it does come with quite a lot of features that a developer most become familiar with first in order to be able to successfully create applications using TypeScript.

TypeScript is a language that has become increasingly popular with the grow of frameworks such as Angular2+ (and there are more and more frontend frameworks that implement TypeScript or provide you with TypeScript spefic implementations).

This course intends to lay down the foundations for you so that you can start to write TypeScript code. It is very important to understand these fundamentals otherwise looking at code written in Angular2+ and TypeScript is going to be very confusing.
